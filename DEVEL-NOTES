Using home_etc in applications being modified.

A few steps which should be done:

    * backup original sources directory under other name,
      e.g: sources-1.0.4.orig, keeping sources-1.0.4 for
      modifications

    * recognize files which requires modification
      (grep she sources against configuration filenames..)

    * add #include <home_etc.h>
      in each file, which will need the library functions
      
    * substitute variables
    
	[home_dir]	--> _HEdir
	[config_file]	--> _HE(config_file)

    * change the compile options by adding: -lhome_etc
    
    * make a: diff -Nur sources-1.0.4.orig sources-1.0.4 > sources-home_etc.patch

    * test if it's working (if not -> back to point 2)
    

Doing it in a proper way.
