#etc
#
# This is HOME-ETC helper file for PLD Linux.
# It allows you to move your configuration files into
# an alternative directory.
#
# See /usr/share/doc/home-etc/README for more info.
#
# First readable line of this file should contain the pathname
# of your personal 'etc' directory. If the given pathname
# is not absolute, then it will be prefixed by the pathname
# of the directory where this file resides.
#
# Note, that this file will be used only if there is no chance
# to obtain the directory using environment variable HOME_ETC
# which should contain the _absolute_ pathname of your directory.
#
# The HOME_ETC environment variable is probably automagicaly set
# for you using this file by profile.d scripts.
#
# If you would like to use the feature just place your path
# in the first line (or uncomment it). Do NOT place any comments
# on the top line if you are using it.
